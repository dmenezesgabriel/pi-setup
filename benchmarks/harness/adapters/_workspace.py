"""Shared workspace utilities for benchmark adapters.

Each adapter creates its own isolated temp directory (via
``with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:``) and then calls
``init_workspace`` to turn it into a proper git root with pre-created
output subdirectories.  After the agent exits, ``snapshot_workspace``
captures every file the agent wrote.
